#  :bowtie: About this application #
:two::hash:With any integer, show the roman numeral;  With any roman numeral, show the integer:1234::x:

##  Original Problem Statement ##
Use your commits to showcase your process, e.g. one commit for each test you add and another commit for each change to the code;

OR Screen record your exercise and commit as you would normally.
We'd like to see this in Java (or Kotlin) for backend development.


So, create a project on a publicly hosted git repository (e.g. github) and implement:
With any integer, show the roman numeral;
With any roman numeral, show the integer.

Please at least do part 1 (at most up to 3000) and if it's still fun and you've got time, feel free to go on to part 2.

Don't worry about how far you get... we're more interested in you reaching the point of a well factored Part 1 that goes to 100 than a hacked together Part 1 & 2 that goes to 3000.
